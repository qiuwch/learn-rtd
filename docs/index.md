## Introduction

This is a project for learning how to use mkdocs and readthedocs website.

In this webpage I will include the features I found useful in mkdocs.

I need cross reference.

Read the docs will by default create outline for a page, can I disable that, or is it better to disable that?

A few things to learn. How to add new pages.

How to reference other pages?
